# Joy Of Painting Teleportation addon

This addon for Merlord's **Joy Of Painting** allows you to enchant paintings and use them as portals to return to the exact spot where they were painted later.

## Requirements

### Joy Of Painting

The original mod and all of its requirements: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53036


## How to Use

Select a completed painting and choose the "View Painting" option. If the painting is eligible to be enchanted, there will be a new section in the UI that works somewhat similarly to vanilla Morrowind item enchanting.  
Once a painting has been enchanted, there will be a "Recall" button on the "View Painting" menu that allows you to instantaneously return to the exact location where it was painted. 

Check the MCM to fine-tune the behavior of the mod.


## Compatibility

Has a compatibility patch for **Seph's Inventory Decorator**: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50582 Enchanted paintings will try to match the appearance of enchanted equipment as defined by that mod. If you do not have that mod installed, there will be settings in the MCM that mimic it for paintings.

Mod is purely MWSE Lua and pluginless so there should be no compatibility issues. Please let me know if you think you've found one.
